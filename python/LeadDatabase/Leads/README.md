This code is not suitable for inclusion in a production system. It would need to be extended to include more error-recovery code and hooks into connected systems. It was developed as a teaching tool and you should implement your own code based on this template.

You can test this code by providing the Munchkin ID for your target instance and the Client ID & Secret for the Launchpoint service it will use to connect to the API.
